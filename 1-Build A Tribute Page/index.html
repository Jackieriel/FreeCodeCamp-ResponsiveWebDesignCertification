		<ul>
			<li>Jonathan was born in Nova Friburgo - Rio de Janeiro - Brazil.
				He is a multi-instrumentalist, has studied piano and as a self-learner has developed skills as a music producer and some string instruments over 10 years.
				<br>
				In <strong>2009</strong> he has begun to learned music productions techniques by self-learning and produced some electronic music singles and has performed as a DJ in electronic music events, doing DJ-sets and live acts.
				<br>
				Along the way, he also was awarded in <strong>3rd place</strong> on an online Remix World Contest promoted by the band Celldweller.
				<br>
				As a listener, he has always been in search of an electronic sound that would provide and melodic line improved, and despite a lot of quality content in the world scene, he never found something that had his particularities as a listener.
				<br>
				After some years in pause and faced with this personal need, in early <strong>2016</strong> he came back to model his artistic project, writing poems and recording improvisations as piano, voice, and guitar.
				<br>
				Upon returning in early <strong>2017</strong>, faced with some impasses in his personal life, the desire arises to present some of his engraved "informal" creations to friends and family.
				<br>
				With a very positive reaction, a great feeling arises that many people could identify with their truths and essence.
				<br>
				<blockquote>"Work and produce all ideas and records of your experience and emotions from real life, turning them into music."</blockquote>
				<br>
			These songs are fragments of his life transcribed in scores. </li>
